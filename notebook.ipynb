    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Biotechnology moves quickly, and meaningful developments are scattered across dozens of news sources, journals, and industry feeds. Manually tracking these updates is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing important signals. Raw article text is noisy and difficult to compare, making it hard to identify which topics are emerging, which are declining, and where industry attention is shifting. There is no simple, automated way to transform daily biotech news into structured, trend-level insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution/Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements an automated RSS-driven pipeline that collects biotech articles, summarizes them using an LLM, and extracts key concepts for trend analysis. A Trend Agent clusters related topics, measures their frequency and momentum, and highlights emerging or unusual patterns across the dataset. The final output is a structured, data-driven trend report that makes it easy to monitor the biotech landscape, spot early signals, and stay informed without manual curation.\n",

To prepare for this transition, a Beta version was released in April for users to preview and test, and a number of improvements were made based on user feedback.\n",

Full text XML is also available through this API for articles in the PMC Open Access Subset. See the PMC OAI-PMH API documentation for details about the changes.\n",
      "Summary text: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has made initial updates to several offerings to support NIH-funded researchers and institutions to comply with the 2024 NIH Public Access Policy, which went into effect July 1, 2025. NCBI will continue to make ongoing improvements over the coming months. These initial changes include guidance on PubMed Central for authors and related to Online First (OLF) articles, updated options in NCBI's My Bibliography tool, and new error messaging and help text within the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) System. Please note that the NIH Public Access Compliance Monitor (PACM) continues to use the 2008 NIH Public Access Policy rules and NCBI cannot ensure the reliability of compliance data in PACM in relation to the revised requirements. For more details on all these updates, visit NCBI Insights.\n",

In preparation for a planned transition to this updated search later this year, NCBI has released a beta version for you to preview and provide feedback on.
