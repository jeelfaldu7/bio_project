    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Biotechnology moves quickly, and meaningful developments are scattered across dozens of news sources, journals, and industry feeds. Manually tracking these updates is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to missing important signals. Raw article text is noisy and difficult to compare, making it hard to identify which topics are emerging, which are declining, and where industry attention is shifting. There is no simple, automated way to transform daily biotech news into structured, trend-level insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution/Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements an automated RSS-driven pipeline that collects biotech articles, summarizes them using an LLM, and extracts key concepts for trend analysis. A Trend Agent clusters related topics, measures their frequency and momentum, and highlights emerging or unusual patterns across the dataset. The final output is a structured, data-driven trend report that makes it easy to monitor the biotech landscape, spot early signals, and stay informed without manual curation.\n",
