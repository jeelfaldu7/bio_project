      "{'title': \"Preview of Upcoming Changes to PMC's eFetch Output\", 'raw_summary': 'In April 2025, the data formats for PMC articles available through eFetch will be updated as part of NLM\\'s ongoing efforts to modernize its products and services. While most of the data will remain unchanged, there are several key differences in the XML and PubMed (formerly MEDLINE) data formats that we\\'d like to highlight for users. (Learn more about eFetch and the rest of the NCBI Entrez Programming Utilities.)\\nIn addition, prior to moving the new formats into production, the new PMC eFetch data formats are now available at a preview location. To use the preview version of PMC\\'s eFetch, update the subdomain of current eFetch URLs that use db=PMC from \"eutils\" to \"eutilspreview\".\\nFor example, to retrieve the XML data format for an article in the PMC Open Access Subset, such as PMC8270360, use the following preview URL, where the subdomain \"eutils\" has been replaced with \"eutilspreview\":\\n\\nhttps://eutilspreview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.cgi?db=pmc&id=PMC8270360&rettype=xml\\n\\nChanges and additions to the XML format\\n\\nWithin <article-id>, there are changes and additional pub-id-types values:\\n            \\npmcaid - replaces \"pmc\" as the value identifying that the value of this element is a PMCID\\npmcid - the unique identifier for the article in PMC\\npmcid-ver - the PMCID with a decimal suffix indicating the version number\\ndoi - the DOI, or Digital Object Identifier, for the article\\npmcaiid - the article instance identifier, used internally at PMC to distinguish between different versions of the article\\n\\n\\nWithin <custom-meta-group>, there are additional <custom-meta> values for article properties and statuses:\\n          \\npmc-status-embargo - indicates if the full text is under embargo. If yes, only the metadata is available until the release date has been reached.\\npmc-prop-open-access - indicates if the article is available for reuse under a Creative Commons or similar license through the PMC Open Access Subset.\\npmc-prop-olf - indicates if this is an Online First (OLF) version of the article.\\npmc-prop-manuscript - indicates if this is the accepted author manuscript version of the article.\\npmc-prop-has-pdf - indicates if there is a PDF available for the article in PMC.\\npmc-prop-has-supplement - indicates if the article has supplementary material available in PMC.\\npmc-prop-pdf-only - indicates if the full text of the article is only available as a PDF in PMC.\\npmc-prop-is-scanned-article - indicates if the article was included as part of a digitization project.\\npmc-prop-preprint - indicates if the article is a preprint, deposited under the NIH Preprint Pilot.\\n\\n\\nImage file names in the xlink:href attribute will include the file extension. In the current output, the file extension is not present.\\nIf additional DOIs, PMCIDs, or PMIDs are associated with a reference in an article\\'s reference list during processing of the article by PMC, they will be added as <pub-id> elements to the reference with attribute values of pub-id-type=\"doi\", pub-id-type=\"pmcid\", and pub-id-type=\"pmid\" respectively.\\n\\nAdditions to the PubMed Format\\nThe updated PubMed format available when using db=pmc with eFetch will include a number of data fields previously unavailable for PMC articles, including:\\n\\nMESH terms when available for MEDLINE-indexed records in PubMed\\nGrant information\\nPreprint indicators\\nAdditional Publication History (PHST) dates\\n\\nPlease reach out to PMC if you have questions or would like to provide feedback.', 'ai_summary': \"Here's the summary of the article in 3 bullet points:\\n\\n1.  **Main Finding:** PMC's eFetch output data formats will be updated in April 2025, introducing significant changes to XML structures (e.g., new `article-id` types, enhanced article property metadata) and adding new fields to the PubMed format (e.g., MESH terms, grant information, preprint indicators); a preview version is currently available for testing.\\n2.  **Key Biological Targets:** N/A (The article details changes to data formats and API outputs, not biological research findings.)\\n3.  **Application Area:** Biotech tools and bioinformatics infrastructure, specifically impacting developers and researchers who programmatically access and process biomedical literature metadata from PMC.\"}\n"
