The search filter \"hassuppdata\" can be used in PMC to discover records with associated supplementary\n        data files.\nIn addition to providing supplementary data with an article, NLM is also encouraging\n        journals and authors to make research data available in a public repository and include the\n        relevant data citation(s) in the paper. Guidance for PMC data providers on tagging data\n        citations is available in the Tagging\n          Guidelines. This guidance is based on the JATS4R recommendations on data citations.\nStarting this month, the NIH Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system will also accept deposits\n        of small datasets accompanying deposits of funded author manuscripts for inclusion of PMC.\n        (Guidance for authors is available in the NIHMS FAQ.)\nIf you have suggestions on future directions in data for PMC to consider, please let us\n        know at pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.",

    "summary_text": "The PMC Overview and FAQ have been updated to\n        provide more information on the Scientific Quality Review Process for journals that apply to\n        participate in PMC.\nIn 2014, PMC implemented a scientific and editorial quality review procedure whereby expert\n        consultants from outside the National Library of Medicine (NLM) conduct an independent\n        review of journals seeking to participate in PMC. This was in response to a significant\n        increase in new publishers and journals applying to participate in PMC, many of which are\n        unknown to NLM in terms of quality and publishing practices. The independent review, which\n        was approved by the PMC National Advisory Committee (see minutes from June\n        10, 2014), follows an assessment by NLM that the journal meets NLM's criteria for its\n        collection, as outlined in the Collection Development\n          Manual.\nPMC also recently updated the minimum requirement on the number of substantive,\n        peer-reviewed articles needed before a journal can apply to PMC. The new 25-article minimum ensures that the reviewers have a\n        sufficient amount of content on which to base their recommendation for inclusion in PMC. The\n        new minimum article requirement takes effect on January 1, 2016. Publishers are encouraged\n        to use the 25-article minimum as a guideline in the interim when submitting\n        applications.",

Similar to UK PubMed Central, PMC Canada will include most of the health and\n        life sciences literature available through the U.S. PMC. PMC Canada will also include\n        research resulting from funding through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).\n        Components of the new repository will include a bilingual interface as well a manuscript\n        submission system for CIHR researchers.\n\n\n",
